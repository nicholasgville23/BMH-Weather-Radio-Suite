# WeatherRadioSuite

A faithful recreation of the National Weather Service's "Broadcast Message Handler" system for NOAA (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) Weather Radio, in Python.

## What can it do?

> - Generate NWR-like audio files utilizing the official VoiceText Paul voice
> - Poll weather information for any US location, utilizing the NWS API
> - Supports Zone Forecast, Local Observations, Hazardous Weather Outlook, Tropical Weather Outlook, Current Time, Local Alert Summary
> - Fully customizable product headers
> - Customizable phoneme/replacement table
> - Randomized observation intro (Like NWS Midland, TX)

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (7 may work; untested and unsupported!); Linux and MacOS may also work with something like WINE, but are both untested and unsupported!
- Python 3.8+ with selected `requirements.txt` packages installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt` if you don't have them)

# Initial setup

## WeatherRadioSuite-LIB

Download the supporting libraries and the TTS engine from a secure download server, located here: https://cdn.dondaplayer.com/WeatherRadioSuite-LIB.zip

Once you've cloned the repo, extract the contents of WeatherRadioSuite-LIB.zip to the root of the project.

After doing so, your directory tree should look something like this:

WeatherRadioSuite:
 - binary/
 - data-common/
 - data-paul/
 - include/
 - the rest of the files (.py, LICENSE, etc)

You can now continue with setup below.

## Observations

Go through `config.example.json` and configure it to your liking, then save it as `config.json`. You can also use the built-in command line flag `--generate-config` to create a default config file (just copies the example for you), or `--interactively-configure` for a (somewhat) guided setup. I recommend spacing out your observation locations evenly. If you're unsure if a location has observations, try placing the location/airport code in https://api.weather.gov/stations/{airportCode}/observations/latest. For example, if I wanted the Kalamazoo/Battle Creek International Airport, I would put `KAZO` in {airportCode} in that link.

Populate `mainObsCode` with your main observation. Then, for `regionalObsCodes`, place as many codes as you would like for the rest of your observations. Your `opener` list can include as many as you would like, you just have to make sure you have each number in `openerList` for each opener in `openers`. If you only want one, remove everything except #1 in both places.

`cityNameDef` is where you can define each location. That way you're not locked in to what the API has the location as. `dividers` is where you can add a 'divider' before a specific location. For example, after my main observation plays, I have it say "Around our local area, Battle Creek..."

## Forecast

Here you can define how many forecast days you want in your forecast. Default is 14, this is odd because it's days and nights. Technically this can be as high as 15, however 14 is the safest as it's not always 15 segments.
The zone is what you want the forecast to be. `MIZ072` is Kalamazoo Co., MI. The zone code is formatted as: State Abbreviation + Z + 3 digit county code. You can find your zone code by going to https://www.weather.gov/ and searching for your location. Once there, click on the "Forecast" link, and in the URL you will see something like "https://forecast.weather.gov/MapClick.php?zoneid=MIZ072". That is your zone code. `Pre/Post` are what come before and after your forecast. If you don't want one, the other, or both, just make them `""`.

## HWO

Set your office's code here. `KGRR` is Grand Rapids, MI. You can find your office code by going to https://www.weather.gov/ and searching for your location. Once there, click on the "About Us" link on the left side. In the URL you will see something like "https://www.weather.gov/grr/about". That is your office code.

## Alert Summary

Here, you need to set the callsign of your station. The Alert Summary has a fixed format, as I never got to the point of making it customizable. You also need to set the zones you want alerts for. I have it set as `MIC077`, which is Kalamazoo Co., MI. You *can* set multiple, however it's not recommended and may result in duplicate alerts. `timezoneLong` could be automated, however it's not. Set it as you see fit.

## Misc. configuration

At the top, you'll see the `ttsSpeed`, `endPause`, `currentTime`, and `globalHTTPTimeout`. TTS Speed should be whatever VoiceText speed you want- there's a discord server that has this information [here](https://discord.gg/JSJXd8pMt2). `endPause` is how long the pause at the end of every file should be, to keep it uniform. `globalHTTPTimeout` is how long the program should wait for an HTTP response before timing out. Default is 15 seconds, which should be fine for most people.

As for `currentTime`, you set your time script format. Don't change this if you don't care. Also, keep date off unless you *really* want it. You'll need to change the timezone as well, it is not automatic yet.

If you don't want your station ID to be it's own static file, you can also just put it before or after the current time script within the file. This is a bit of an advanced option though, and will slow down generation, as it will synthesize your ID every single time it re-pulls the time. So, although this is an option, I do NOT recommend it.

## Phonemes/replacements

In `phonemeDB.json`, you'll find a common list of replacements that I have pre-curated. If you're not a fan of some of them, you can remove them, and also add to them as you see fit. There's information for these in the discord server I listed above. **That server is NOT related to this project and is purely just a resource for the VoiceText Paul voice.**

# Usage

Once you've done the initial setup, run `main.py` with Python. This will run all of your scripts at initial setup, and then count down 10 minutes after the last one until the script restarts and pulls everything again. The current time is re-pulled and re-generated every minute.

I cannot and **will not** help you set this software up. I have explained a little on how to use it, and eventually I'd like to make proper documentation on every way you can utilize the software. However for now it's not possible.

I recommend using a free software called "ZaraRadio" as your playout/playlist management program. It's quite robust for this purpose and offers some relatively powerful automation in a simple package. You can set up hourly scheduled events if you'd like your station ID played at a certain interval.

If a file was not mentioned in this "README", ***Do Not Touch It***. It is likely crucial to the function of the program.

# Miscellanea

If you encounter an issue with the software, feel free to create an issue. I can't guarantee I will be able to fix everything, which is why this is open source. If it's something you can fix, feel free to create a pull request and it will be reviewed in a timely manner.
